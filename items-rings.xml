  <element name="Ring of Natural Regeneration" type="Magic Item" source="Homebrewed" id="ID_HMBW_MAGIC_ITEM_RING_OF_NATURAL_REGENERATION">
		<description>
		  <p>This ring is crafted from living wood, with tiny vines and leaves that seem to shift and grow as it is worn. The centerpiece is a glowing green gem, pulsing faintly like a heartbeat. The ring was first created by an archdruid who sought to bind themselves to the cycle of life, allowing their body to recover just as the forest heals itself.</p>
      <h3>Effects</h3>
      <h4>Sunlight Regeneration (<em>Primary Ability</em>)</h4><br/>
     	<p class="indent">While in direct sunlight, you regain 5 hit points per round (at the start of your turn).</p>
			<p class="indent">This regeneration does not function if you have taken fire or necrotic damage in the last round.</p>

      <h4>Druidic Vitality (<em>Passive Bonus</em>)</h4><br/>
      <p class="indent">You have advantage on death saving throws.</p>
      <p class="indent">You regain double the normal hit points from natural rest.</p>

      <h4>Natureâ€™s Recovery (Once per Day)</h4><br/>
      <p class="indent">As a bonus action, you can regrow lost body parts (such as fingers, ears, or even a limb) over 1 minute.</p>
      <p class="indent">This effect does not work on the dead, nor can it restore a severed head.</p>

      <h4>Verdant Shield (Reaction, 2x per Long Rest)</h4><br/>
      <p class="indent">When you take bludgeoning, slashing, or piercing damage, the ring summons a protective barkskin shield, granting you temporary hit points equal to half the damage taken.</p>
