      <h4>APPEARANCE</h4>
      <p>Mothkin are moth-like humanoids adorned with fur, antennae, and finely scaled wings. Though they tend to be small, some subraces are comparable in size to larger races like humans and orcs.
      They can be nearly any color, and have an equally wide variety of patterns on their wings. Although most colorings developed over several generations to provide camouflage, many mothkin take great pride in dyeing new, decorative patterns into their wings.
      However, even mothkin with more subtle natural coloring can still possess intricate and beautiful patterns on their wings. Their wings come in many shapes and sizes and may have long tails. These tails do not affect their flight abilities at all, instead existing solely to provide a distraction to predators.
      Most Mothkin cannot fly when wet. Most mothkin possess feathery antennae, but some may more closely resemble the clubbed antennae of butterflies. They generally have compound eyes which take up a considerable portion of their faces, providing them with darkvision at the expense of reduced resolution.</p> 
	    <h4>HISTORY</h4>
      <p>Mothkin are believed to have a common ancestor, Ibuluna Mori. Her story has become increasingly inconsistent throughout time, leaving the origins of their race a mystery. The most prevalent of these stories depicts her as a goddess who grew dissatisfied with the many conflicts between not only the gods, but the mortals they ruled over too.
      She took solace in Eiovini, the goddess of dawn, who shared her belief that neutrality is true bliss and being purely either good or evil leads to anger and sadness. One-day they both agreed to give up divinity for a simple life together as mortals, dividing their lost powers across the population of their favorite beings within the mortal realm as a final blessing.
      These beings would later evolve into mothkin (Through the power of Ibuluna's blessing) and spiderkin (Through Eiovini's blessing). Mothkin have existed ever since for generations, mostly hiding away in deep forests, cave systems, or other environs that are far from wider society. Because of this, they have been largely unknown to outsiders for much of history.</p>
