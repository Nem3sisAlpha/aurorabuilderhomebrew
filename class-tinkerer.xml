		<description>
			<p>A Tinkerer can use their action to create a mechanical device. Each device has a different effect and tinker point cost:</p>
			<h5 class="caption">Flash Bang: <i>(1 tinker point, 1lbs Material)</i></h5>
			<p>You gain a +2 bonus to attack rolls you make with ranged weapons.</p>
			<h5 class="caption">Mechanical Shield: <i>(2 tinker point, 6lbs Material)</i></h5>
			<p>While you are wearing armor, you gain a +1 bonus to AC.</p>
			<h5 class="caption">Explosive: <i>(1 tinker point, 3lbs Material)</i></h5>
			<p>When you are wielding a melee weapon in one hand and no other weapons, you gain a +2 bonus to damage rolls with that weapon.</p>
			<h5 class="caption">Lesser Explosive: <i>(1 tinker point, 1lbs Material)</i></h5>
			<p>When you roll a 1 or 2 on a damage die for an attack you make with a melee weapon that you are wielding with two hands, you can reroll the die and must use the new roll, even if the new roll is a 1 or a 2.

		<description>
			<h4>Inspire Genialty</h4>
			<p>Tinkerers can use their brilliance to grant themselves and others a better chance to succeed at tasks. You can use this in the following ways:</p>
			<h5 class="caption">Helpful Advice:</h5>
			<p>You can use Help as a bonus action on a creature you can see within 30 feet.</p>
			<h5 class="caption">Quick Lesson:</h5>
			<p>You can use your action to give guidance to one allied creature within 30 feet. That creature gains a d4 that can be spent on the next ability check it makes within the next hour.</p>
			<h5 class="caption">Moment of Geniality:</h5>
			<p>You can give yourself and others an extra d4 in any ability check, saving throw or attack roll. You can use this feature a number of times equal to half your level in this class, and regain your uses after completing either a short or long rest. The Inspire geniality die grows to a d6 at the 5th level, a d8 at the 11th level, and a d10 at the 17th level.</p>

		<description>
			<h4>Practical Improvisation</h4>
			<p>when reaching level 2, A Tinkerer can turn anything into a deadly weapon using their wits and creative prowess. You gain proficiency with all improvised weapons for 1 hour and can add half of your proficiency bonus (rounded down) to any ability check or saving throw once every short or long rest. The player must use this ability before they know if the roll succeeds or fails. At full potential, a tinkerer may use their Intelligence modifier for attack rolls made with improvised weapons. They can also use this to gain proficiency with improvised tools (improvising a lockpick out of a toothpick etc).</p>

		<h4>Lesser Tiers:</h4>
		<p>Only one lesser tier enchantment may be placed on an item and the item cannot have been previously enchanted. You must succeed an Intelligence check based on GM discretion. Enchantments can either be passive (background effects) or active (triggered via an action) but cannot be both.</p>
		<h4>Full Tiers:</h4>
		<p>Unlocking a full tier allows you to add multiple enchantments to a single item. This could mean either: the same spell is applied to an item but in both its active and passive forms, OR multiple spells of the same form are applied to a single item. If multiple enchantments are applied, their combined spell levels must be less than or equal to your enchantment tier level. How these enchantments work with each other is for you to decide, however, your GM has a veto over what can and cannot be done. Each enchantment requires its own intelligence check. If one Intelligence check fails, the others remain unaffected. The item cannot have any previous enchantments on it.</p>
		<h4>Resulting Items:</h4>
		<p>Active enchantments require charges, with each cast using 1 charge per spell level (Cantrip level spells, do not use charges). If the item has an active enchantment, you can take an action to recharge it with a ratio of one tinker point per charge. During enchantment, you may use up to your tinkerer level of extra tinker points to: improve your Intelligence check and/or additional charges.</p>

On a 1, the item is cursed and you need to roll a d4 to determine the curse</description>

	<element name="Contruct Tier 1" type="Specialization Feature" source="Homebrewed" id="ID_HB_SPECIALIZATION_FEATURE_CONSTRUCTT1">
		<description>
			<p>During your next long rest, you can create what is known as an “Iron Pup.” You must use 3lbs of Materials and 7 tinker points to create a tiny construct in the shape of a mechanical puppy that has 13 AC, 15 HP, a speed of 25ft, a Strength score of 8, and a bite attack that deals 1d4 + 1 points of piercing damage. It is immune to poison and psychic damage, as well as diseases. It is resistant to cold, fire, force, radiant, and necrotic damage. It is vulnerable to piercing and lightning damage. It has mechanical lungs so it does require air to breathe. Only its creator can control it and it can’t be persuaded to go against a command its creator gives it.</p>
			<p>It can perform a few simple commands like fetching a given object, holding open a door, or flipping a switch. Other tasks can be negotiated with the GM. Only one construct can be active at a time.</p>

	<element name="Contruct Tier 2" type="Specialization Feature" source="Homebrewed" id="ID_HB_SPECIALIZATION_FEATURE_CONSTRUCTT2">
		<description>
			<p>During your next short or long rest, you can upgrade your construct using 5 lbs of metal and 10 tinker points. It is now a medium construct and can take on one of two variants:</p>
			
			<h4>Iron defender</h4>
			<p>
				AC = 18
				HP = 30
				Speed = 35 ft
				Strength = 15
				Bite Attack = 2d6 + 4 piercing
				Claw Attack = 2d6 + 2 slashing
			</p>
			<h4>Commands:</h4>
			<p>Protect - Construct protects you or another creature as a bonus action. When within 5ft, the selected creature’s AC increases by 2. When the creature moves, it follows as far as its movement speed will allow it. When another creature attacks the selected creature, the construct makes a bite attack as a reaction. When another creature disengages from the selected creature, the construct takes an attack of opportunity as well.</p>
			<p>Heal - Construct heals you or another creature for 1d8 + 2 hit points as an action (can be used twice per short rest). The defender must be within 5ft of the target and uses 5 of your tinker points.</p>
			<h4>Emotional Connection:</h4>
			<p>If you are damaged, the construct stops its action to come to your aid and uses its reaction to either heal or bite your attacker.</p>
			
			<h4>Iron Hound</h4>
			<p>
				AC = 18
				HP = 30
				Speed = 35 ft
				Strength = 15
				Bite Attack = 2d6 + 4 piercing
				Claw Attack = 2d6 + 2 slashing
			</p>
			<h4>Commands:</h4>
			<p>Attack - Construct attacks a target creature of choice. It deals both a claw and bite attack with an advantage if it doesn’t have to move to the target. It does not have an advantage if the hound has to move to attack, but still multi-attacks.</p>
			<p>Scout - Construct scouts ahead of you up to their movement speed before returning. Upon returning, it projects an image of what it saw using 5 of your tinker points.</p>
			<h4>Emotional Connection:</h4>
			<p>If you are damaged, the construct stops its action to come to your aid and uses its reaction to both bites and claw your attacker.</p>
			<p>As well as affecting the construct’s reaction in battle emotional connection affects you. If the construct is destroyed, you have a disadvantage on each proceeding roll equal to the number of days your construct was active. You also immediately lose as many tinkers' points equal to the number of days they were active and cannot make a new construct until half of those days have passed.</p>

	<element name="Contruct Tier " type="Specialization Feature" source="Homebrewed" id="ID_HB_SPECIALIZATION_FEATURE_CONSTRUCTT3">
		<description>
			<p>During your next short or long rest, you can upgrade your tier 2 construct using 10 lbs of metal and 10 tinker points. Your construct takes on one of two variants:</p>
			
			<h4>Iron Bastion (from Defender)</h4>
			<p>
				AC = 20
				HP = 60
				Speed = 60 ft
				Strength = 19
				Bite Attack = 4d6 + 4 piercing
				Claw Attack = 3d6 + 2 slashing
				1 Level 1 spell slot, which can be used as an action for 5 tinker points
			</p>
			<h4>Commands:</h4>
			<p>Protect - (same as tier 2)</p>
			<p>Heal - (same as tier 2)</p>
			<p>Change Form - For 15 tinker points, the construct increases in size to become a large creature of the same shape. It takes on the stats and feats of the “shield guardian” creature including movement speed and excluding bound. The spell it has stored is the same one you gave it when upgrading your defender to tier 3. It remains under your control but has its own turn which follows yours.</p>
			<p>Once you’ve commanded it to change the form, you can take a bonus action to mount it. This makes you both invulnerable to melee attacks and unable to make them yourself unless the creature is flying. You can move your bastion on your turn or its turn, but not both. It returns to its tier 2 form after 5 rounds of combat and must be upgraded to tier 3 again.</p>

			<h4>Iron Defiler (from Hound)</h4>
			<p>
				AC = 18
				HP = 130
				Speed = 65
				Strength = 21
				Bite Attack = 4d8 + 4 piercing
				Claw Attack = 3d8 + 4 slashing
			</p>
			<h4>Commands:</h4>
			<p>Attack - (same as tier 2)</p>
			<p>Scout - (same as tier 2)</p>
			<p>Change Form - For 15 tinker points, the construct stands on its hind legs and increases in size to become a large creature. It takes on the abilities and feats of the “iron golem” creature including movement speed. It remains under your control but has its own turn which follows yours. It returns to its tier 2 form after 4 rounds of combat and must be upgraded to tier 3 again.</p>
