			<p>This amulet is crafted from polished bone, entwined with vines and set with a glowing emerald. Its aura hums with primal energy, and those who wear it claim to hear whispers of ancient beasts guiding their actions. The first amulet was said to be gifted by a fey guardian to a druid who sought to master their Wild Shape.</p>
